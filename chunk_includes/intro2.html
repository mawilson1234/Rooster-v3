<b>Instructions</b>
</p>

<p>
In the experiment, you are going to be reading each sentence as a series of words. So, you will only see one part of the sentence at a time. When a sentence first appears, it will look like a series of dashes, like this:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
— —
</p>
<p>
After the sentence has automatically begun with the dashes, you can press the <b>space bar</b> to continue. This will cause the current word to disappear, and will reveal the next one. So when you press the space bar for the first time, the display changes to look something like this:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
The
</p>
And when you press it again, that first word disappears to reveal the next word:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
 puppies
</p>

Continue hitting the space bar all the way through to the end of the sentence, revealing the sentence word by word.</P>

<p>
The sentences are long, so it is important that you make sure you understand each word as you read it. <b>It is very important that you do not 'rush' to get to the end of the sentence!</b> If you do this, you are very likely to miss important pieces of the sentence. So please read deliberately, making sure you fully understand each word as you read it. </b>
