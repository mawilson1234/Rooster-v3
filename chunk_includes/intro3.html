<b>Instructions</b>
</p>


<p>
After you have finished reading each sentence, you will see a question about the sentence <b>you just read</b>. Every question has two possible answers, one on the left, and one on the right. You can indicate your response by pressing "<b>f</b>" if you think answer on the <b>left</b> is correct, and "<b>j</b>" if you think the answer on the <b>right</b> is correct.
</p>
<p>
To help you answer the questions accurately, we recommend you try to <b>mentally picture</b> the scenario described in each sentence as you're reading through it word by word. This will help you fully understand each sentence so you can answer the questions correctly more easily.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the experiment, you should always keep your hands positioned so that your thumbs are on the space bar, and your index fingers are on the "f" and "j" keys. Remember, please try to press the space bar fast enough to allow for relatively natural reading of the sentence.
</p>

<p>
To ensure that you can see all of the sentences you will read, please maximize your browser screen now, and close any other open windows.
</p>

<p>
There will be two chances for you to take a break during the experiment. You will see a message that lets you know this, and you can return to the experiment by pressing any key when you are ready. We ask that you not take breaks except when you see this prompt, and that you keep breaks reasonably brief.
